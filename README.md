# Moufette (Community Edition)

It's critical to get very early feedback when you start working on a new app. Moufette is an open-soruce, built for developers. To give a voice to your users so they can help you build, **persevere** or **pivot**!

It's a 1 click to deploy on your own infrastructure, with full API/DB access to the underlying data.


## Demo

[Moufette Dashboard](https://moufette-demo.herokuapp.com/)
   - username: `demo@moufette.com`
   - password: `123123`

The widget was embedded in the dashboard itself but you can use it on any other website.

## Quick start

1 click Heroku deploy:

## Philosophy

Many engineers find it painful to work out how their products are being used and struggle to get the critical early feedback they need to help them navigate the product development and prioritize a long list of features. Moufette is here to solves that.

Moufette is **not** an anylitics tool replacement but rather a complementary. It's important to understand how users behaive on your website but in many cases you can't make any sence of thier random clicks and scrolling. So why not just ask them! People love to tell what they think or even criticise espically if they think your are wrong ([Cunningham's Law](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law)). And this is exactly what you need at this stage.

We also strongly believe 3rd party tools don't work anymore in a world of Cookie laws, GDPR, CCPA and lots of other 4 letter acronyms. There should be an alternative to sending all of your users' personal information to 3rd parties. Moufette gives you full control over all your users' data.
